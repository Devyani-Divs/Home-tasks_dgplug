    My name is K.Devyani, 2nd year student, CSE dept, studying in Dr.B.C.Roy Engineering College, Durgapur. I am from Kharagpur. My hobbies are painting, skating, playing guitar, listening to music and gaming. Am aquainted with programming languages like C, C++and Java. And lastly, love coding and am enjoying this new experience with FOSS.

    A few words about the dgplug summer training, am loving the part that am learning a lot more stuff than just a new language (python). Not only that am getting to learn new things, but it is helping me how to approach problems, i.e. helping me learn how to make systematic approaches. I owe a sincere thanks to kushal for being patient enough with the students. Though am having a tough time keeping up, but still enjoying the experience.
