    My name is K.Devyani, 2nd year student, CSE dept, studying in Dr.B.C.Roy Engineering College, Durgapur. I am from Kharagpur. My hobbies are painting, skating, playing guitar, listening to music and gaming. Am aquainted with programming languages like C, C++and Java. And, lastly, i want to become a succesful softwarengineer.

    A few words about the dgplug summer training, am loving the part that am learning a lot more stuff than just a new language (python), and having a tough time keeping up. Not only that am getting to learn new things, but it is helping me how to approach problems, i.e. helping me learn how to make systematic approaches. I owe a sincere thanks to kushal for being patient enough with the students.
